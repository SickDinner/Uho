    'frame_width': 16,
    'frame_height': 16,
    'animations': {
        'idle_south': {'frames': [0], 'duration': 1000, 'loop': True},
        'walk_south': {'frames': [0, 1, 2, 3], 'duration': 200, 'loop': True},
        'idle_west': {'frames': [4], 'duration': 1000, 'loop': True},
        'walk_west': {'frames': [4, 5, 6, 7], 'duration': 200, 'loop': True},
